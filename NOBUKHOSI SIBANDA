- 👋 Hi, I’m Nobukhosi Sibanda. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming and Coding( exploring languages like Python, SQL to manipulate and analyze data), Machine Learning, Big Data and Data Visualization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create projects using this platform.
- 💞️ I am not yet looking for collaborations.
- 📫 How to reach me: nobbyspearl@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/ her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Unlike most programming languages, Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks. This makes Python code cleaner and easier to read but also means indentation errors can lead to major bugs!
